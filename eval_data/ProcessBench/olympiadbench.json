      "Consider the even-odd property. If a number is the sum of two palindromes, then one or both must be even if the sum is even. This is because an odd palindrome added to another odd palindrome results in an even number. Conversely, adding an even palindrome to any other palindrome (even or odd) results in an even sum.",
      "Identify numbers that cannot be expressed as the sum of two palindromes. We know that every even number greater than 10 can be expressed as the sum of two primes (Goldbach's conjecture), and since most primes are not palindromes, this doesn't directly apply here. However, for our purposes, we can look at how even and odd numbers behave when trying to express them as the sum of two palindromes.",
      "Look for patterns. Let's start checking from 2014, the first number greater than 2013:\n- 2014 = 2002 + 12 (both are palindromes)\n- 2015 = 2002 + 13 (13 is not a palindrome, but we can try other combinations)\n- ...\n- Eventually, we reach 2101, which is itself a palindrome. Any number below 2101 can be expressed as the sum of two palindromes (e.g., 2098 = 2002 + 96).",
      "Check 2102:\n- 2102 cannot be expressed as the sum of two palindromes. If we try to add a 4-digit palindrome to another palindrome to get 2102, the palindrome would have to end in 2 or 12. The closest palindrome to 2102 that ends in 2 is 2102 itself, but then the other palindrome would have to be 0, which is not allowed as per the question's constraint.",
      "Conclusion. The smallest integer greater than 2013 that cannot be written as the sum of two palindromes is \\(\\boxed{2102}\\)."

      "To solve this problem, we will use several properties of geometry, particularly related to circles and quadrilaterals. Let's break down the steps: First, we understand the given information. We have a quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\) where \\(\\angle B + \\angle D = 270^\\circ\\). The circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\) intersects \\(\\overline{CD}\\) at point \\(E\\), distinct from \\(D\\). Additionally, \\(BC = 4\\), \\(CE = 5\\), and \\(DE = 7\\).",
      "Next, we apply properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and circles. Since \\(E\\) lies on the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\), \\(E\\) is also part of the circumcircle of \\(\\square ABCD\\) (assuming \\(ABCD\\) is cyclic, which will be justified later). In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum up to \\(180^\\circ\\). Given \\(\\angle B + \\angle D = 270^\\circ\\), it suggests an error in our initial understanding or misinterpretation since angles cannot sum to more than \\(360^\\circ\\) in a quadrilateral. However, if we consider the context, let's assume a correction was intended for the sake of explanation: Correct interpretation: If we adjust for logical consistency, perhaps the intention was to imply that one of the angles at \\(B\\) or \\(D\\) is \\(90^\\circ\\) (since this would fit the property of cyclic quadrilaterals better, aligning with the geometry principles involved). For this explanation, let's proceed with an assumption that either \\(\\angle B\\) or \\(\\angle D\\) is \\(90^\\circ\\), aiming for a coherent solution path.",
      "We then use the Power of a Point Theorem. The Power of a Point Theorem states that for a point \\(P\\) outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the two segments from \\(P\\) to the circle equals the product of the lengths of the other two segments when considering tangents or secants from that point. However, in this case, \\(E\\) is not outside but on the circumference of the circle, and we apply it differently: Given \\(BC = 4\\) and \\(CE = 5\\), \\(DE = 7\\), and knowing \\(E\\) is part of the circumcircle, we can apply the property of intersecting chords in a circle, which states that the product of the lengths of the segments of one chord is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the other chord.

      "This discrepancy suggests a reevaluation of the given values or a misunderstanding in their application within the context provided. However, for the purpose of demonstrating the method:",
      "Finally, we find the diameter of the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\). The key to finding the diameter involves recognizing that the circumcircle's radius or diameter is crucial for calculating distances involving points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(D\\). However, without specific details about how \\(E\\) relates to these points geometrically beyond being on the circle, or additional information such as the length of another segment or angle measures, directly calculating the diameter becomes complex.",
      "Insight: The question's focus on \\(E\\) and its relation to \\(BC\\), \\(CE\\), and \\(DE\\) might suggest looking at the properties of chords in a circle or applying trigonometric relationships based on the angles given initially. However, due to the discrepancy noted and the complexity introduced by the misinterpretation of the angle condition, a direct calculation for the diameter of the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\) isn't straightforward with the information provided.",
      "In conclusion, given the complexities and discrepancies in the original problem statement, particularly with the angles summing to 270 degrees in a quadrilateral, the solution path becomes less clear. The explanation provided aimed to creatively interpret and apply geometric principles under the constraints of the given information. However, the direct calculation for the diameter of the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\) requires additional, precise information about the positions and relationships of the points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\), and \\(E\\) within the quadrilateral and its circumcircle."

Consider the case where $\\gcd(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) = 2$. Since $f(m) + n$ and $f(n) + m$ must both be even for their GCD to be 2, it implies $f(m)$ and $m$ have the same parity for all $m$.

Even if $k$ is even, choosing $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m) + n$ and $f(n) + m$ have a difference of at least $k$ ensures that they share a non-trivial common factor, violating the $k$-good property.",

      "First, fixing any of the coordinates to be zero will not cover all the points in the other two coordinates. For example, if we fix $x=0$, we won't cover the points where $y=n$ and $z=n$. However, for each fixed coordinate, we can draw a plane that contains all the points with that coordinate equal to zero. Let's denote this plane as $P_{0,i,j}$ where $i$ and $j$ are the other two coordinates. For instance, if we fix $x=0$, the corresponding plane is $P_{0,y,z}$ where $y$ and $z$ vary from $1$ to $n$.",

When we added the additional planes for each type of plane, we counted some of the points twice. To correct this, we need to subtract the number of points that were counted twice. Each point was counted twice in the additional planes, so we need to subtract $n^2$ to correct the overcount.",

      "Initial Observation: First, note that the smallest possible sum of any pair in the set is $1 + 2 = 3$, and the largest possible sum using two distinct elements is $(n-1) + n = 2n - 1$. However, since the sum cannot exceed $n$, we're only interested in sums up to $n$.",
      "Considering the Sums: For sums up to $n$, we can start by considering the smallest possible sums. For example, if $n=5$, the possible sums are $3, 4, 5$. For $n=6$, they are $3, 4, 5, 6$. We see a pattern here: for any $n \\geq 1$, the smallest possible sum is $3$, and the largest possible (and valid) sum is $n$.",

      "Generalizing: We generalize this idea. For each sum $s$ (where $3 \\leq s \\leq n$), we can find at least one pair that achieves this sum. The key insight is that as we increase $s$, the pairs we use do not overlap because the second element of the pair increases. For example, for $s=3$, the pair is $(1, 2)$.

However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\n\nUnfortunately for new development, ARMLopolis is full: every nonnegative integer corresponds to (exactly one) house (or City Hall, in the case of 0). However, eighteen families arrive and are looking to move in. After much debate, the connotations of using negative house numbers are deemed unacceptable, and the city decides on an alternative plan. On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move). For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35.\nRoss takes a walk starting at his house, which is number 34 .

Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \\ldots$, and each time, $d\\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\\right)=1 / 3$. At the end of the day, what is his maximum possible distance from his original house? Justify your answer.",

      "Now, let's consider Ross's walk. He starts at house 34. To visit house \\( n_1 \\) such that \\( d(n_1, 34) = 1/3 \\), we need to find a house \\( n_1 \\) that satisfies the condition \\( d(n_1) = d(34 + 18) = 1/3 \\). We know that \\( d(34 + 18) = d(52) = 1/3 \\), so Ross can visit house 52.",

However, we already know that \\( d(34) = 1/3 \\), so Ross can visit the house he started at, which is house 34.",
      "Now, he visits houses \\( n_3, n_4, \\ldots \\), and each time, \\( d(n_i, n_{i+1}) = 1/3 \\). This creates a sequence of houses where each house is 1/3 unit away from the previous house. Since the houses are arranged in a circular pattern around City Hall, we can think of this sequence as a circle with a radius of 1/3 unit.",

The farthest point on a circle with a radius of 1/3 unit from a fixed point (in this case, house 34) would be on the opposite side of the circle. However, since the houses are at integer coordinates, the farthest house would be at a distance of 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1 unit.",
      "But there are only 6 houses in total that are 1/3 unit away from house 34, and they form a circle around house 34.

      "To determine the largest value of \\( k \\) for which there are \\( k \\) cells on a \\( 2011 \\times 2011 \\) table that all contain the same nonzero number, we need to analyze the placement of napkins, each covering a \\( 52 \\times 52 \\) square, and the resulting coverage pattern. First, let's consider the total number of cells on the table: \\[ 2011^2 \\] Each napkin covers: \\[ 52^2 = 2704 \\text{ cells} \\]",
      "First, let's calculate the minimum number of napkins needed to cover the entire table.

      "Next, we determine the maximum possible overlap. We need to maximize the number of cells that are covered by the same number of napkins. Let's denote this number by \\( m \\). The key is to ensure that the configuration allows for the maximum number of cells to have the same coverage \\( m \\).",
      "Consider a regular tiling pattern. A regular tiling pattern where napkins are placed such that they overlap in a controlled manner can help us achieve the maximum \\( k \\). One such pattern is to place napkins in a grid-like structure with a specific offset to maximize overlap.",
      "Now, let's calculate the overlap. If we place napkins in a grid with a spacing of \\( 52 - 1 = 51 \\) cells, each cell will be covered by multiple napkins. Specifically, a cell in the interior of the table will be covered by: \\[ 52 \\times 52 = 2704 \\text{ napkins} \\] However, this is not feasible since we only have 1496 napkins. Instead, we need to find the optimal spacing that maximizes the overlap while using exactly 1496 napkins. By placing napkins in a grid with a spacing of 1 cell, we can achieve a high overlap.

Therefore, we need to adjust our approach to ensure that the number of cells with the same coverage is within the table's capacity.",
      "Finally, by adjusting the spacing and ensuring that the number of cells covered by the same number of napkins is maximized, we find that the largest value of \\( k \\) is achieved when each cell is covered by the same number of napkins as many times as possible. After detailed calculations and analysis, we find that the largest value of \\( k \\) is: \\[ \\boxed{2704} \\]"

At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$.

However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$.

First, the distance from City Hall: If a house has a number that can be expressed as \\( n = 3^k n' \\) where \\( n' \\) is not divisible by 3, the distance from City Hall to this house is \\( d(n) = 3^{-k} \\). Second, the distance between two houses: The distance from house \\( n \\) to house \\( m \\) is simply the difference \\( d(m-n) \\). This implies that moving forward or backward along the street changes the distance linearly. Given these rules, we aim to find the house or houses with the smallest distance to City Hall among all positive numbers less than 100.",
      "The key insight is recognizing how the distance decreases with increasing powers of 3 in the house number. Specifically, the distance is inversely proportional to the power of 3 in the house number representation.",

      "Numbers like 2, 4, 5, etc., do not directly fit into our formula since they don't have a clear power of 3 component in their factorization without being multiples of these powers. However, considering the rule about the distance between houses being simply \\( d(m-n) \\), we can see that minimizing the distance involves minimizing the absolute value of \\( n - m \\) while keeping \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) close to a power of 3.",
      "Given the constraints and the nature of the distances provided, the house(s) with the smallest distance to City Hall among those with positive numbers less than 100 are those closest to powers of 3. Here, based on the calculations:\n- \\( d(3) = 1/3 \\)\n- \\( d(9) = 1/9 \\)",
      "Between these two, \\( d(9) \\) offers a smaller distance to City Hall when compared to \\( d(3) \\). Thus, the house with the number 9 is closer to City Hall than any other positive number less than 100 under these rules.",
      "Proof: Any house with a number that isn't a power of 3 or a multiple of a power of 3 would have a distance greater than 1/9 due to the way distances decrease with increasing powers of 3. Therefore, the house with number 9 is indeed the one closest to City Hall among all positive numbers less than 100."

Third, no three circles share a common tangent, meaning there are no three circles where a single line can be a tangent to all three.",

The total number of pairs of circles can be found using the combination formula, \"n choose 2,\" which is n*(n-1)/2. In this case, n = 2017. The maximum possible number of tangent segments would be twice this amount, since there are two tangent segments per pair of circles: 2 * 2017 * (2017 - 1) / 2 = 2017 * 2016.",
      "However, this calculation includes all possible pairs of circles. But since Luciano stops drawing when no more tangent segments can be drawn, we should consider the fact that some combinations might be impossible due to the arrangement of circles. In reality, it is always possible to draw at least one tangent segment for every pair of circles, as long as no two circles are tangent and no three circles share a tangent. However, we must also account for cases where certain arrangements may limit the total number of possible tangent segments.",
      "Upon further consideration, we realize that any arrangement of circles that allows fewer than the maximum number of tangent segments would imply that some circles are \"blocking\" potential tangent segments. However, this contradicts our assumption that no tangent segment intersects any other circles or previously drawn tangent segments. Therefore, Luciano can draw either 0 (if he chooses not to draw any), or the maximum possible number of tangent segments. Additionally, any number less than the maximum could be achieved by simply choosing not to draw some of the tangent segments.",
      "So, the possible numbers of tangent segments Luciano can draw are all even numbers from 0 to 2017 * 2016. \\boxed{Any even number from 0 to 2017*2016, inclusive.}"

Recall that the product of the first five terms was 32, so we can rewrite this as: a * ar * ar^2 * ar^3 * ar^4 = 32. Using the fact that ar^3 = 17, we can rewrite this as: a * ar * ar^2 * 17 * ar^4 = 32. Combine like terms to get: a * ar * ar^2 * ar^5 * 17 = 32. Simplify the left side: a^3 * r^8 * 17 = 32.",

Apply exponent rules: 17^3 * r^8 / r^9 = 32. Now simplify the exponents: 17^3 / r = 32. Now we have two equations involving 'r': 1) 17^5 / r^5 = 32, 2) 17^3 / r = 32.",

Now simplify the exponents: (17^4)^2 / r^6 = 1024. Apply exponent rules: (17^4)^2 = r^6 * 1024. Simplify the left side: 17^8 = r^6 * 1024. Now simplify the exponents: (17^4)^2 = r^6 * 1024. Apply exponent rules: 17^4 = r^3 * 16. Now simplify the exponents: 17^4 = r^3 * 2^4. Factor out 17^4: 17^4 = r^3 * 2^4. Divide both sides by 2^4: 17^4 / 2^4 = r^3. Apply exponent rules: (17/2)^4 = r^3. Take the cube root of both sides: (17/2) = r.",
      "Now substitute r = 17/2 back into one of the equations for 'a': a = 17 / (17/2)^3. Simplify the right side: a = 17 / ((17)^3 / (2)^3). Apply exponent rules: a = 17 * (2)^3 / (17)^3. Simplify the left side: a = 17 * 8 / 4913. a = 136 / 4913. Now that we have the values of 'a' and 'r', we can find the second term of the geometric progression: Second term = a * r = (136 / 4913) * (17 / 2) = 136 * 17 / (4913 * 2) = 2312 / 9826 = 1156 / 4913. Now simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2: = 578 / 2456.5. However, the question wants an exact number, so we simplify this fraction by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2 to remove the decimal in the denominator. = (578*2)/(2456.5*2) = 1156/4913. The exact answer can also be written as a decimal and rounded to 4 decimal places, but since the question asks for an exact answer, we'll leave it as a fraction. So, the second term of the geometric progression is \\boxed{1156/4913}."

      "### Step 4: Verifying the Conditions\n1. **Order Dependence**: The rule depends only on the relative order of the cards, not on their specific values.\n2. **Strict Inequality Condition**: If \\(a_i > b_i\\) for all \\(i\\), then \\(A\\) will have 100 such pairs, clearly winning.\n3. **Transitivity**: If \\(A\\) beats \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) beats \\(C\\), then \\(A\\) will have more than 100 pairs where \\(a_i > b_i\\). Since \\(B\\) beats \\(C\\), \\(B\\) will have more than 100 pairs where \\(b_i > c_i\\). Combining these, \\(A\\) will have more than 100 pairs where \\(a_i > c_i\\), ensuring \\(A\\) beats \\(C\\).",

If a different rule exists, it must also be consistent with the transitivity and strict inequality conditions. However, any deviation from the majority comparison rule would either violate the strict inequality condition or the transitivity, making it impossible to satisfy all conditions simultaneously.",

    "problem": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.",
    "steps": [
      "To determine the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\) in a full town \\( \\mathcal{F}_d \\), we start by analyzing the properties of a full town.

      "A resident cycle of length \\( k \\) corresponds to a cycle of length \\( k \\) in this complete graph.

Since the shortest distance from \\( P \\) to the circle is 4, and \\( \\overline{AB} \\) is 2 units away from \\( \\overleftrightarrow{OP} \\), this implies that \\( \\overline{AB} \\) is located 2 units inside the circle relative to \\( P \\).",
      "Third, we find the length of \\( \\overline{AB} \\): To find the length of \\( \\overline{AB} \\), we need to understand its position relative to the circle's radius. Since the chord is 2 units away from the perpendicular distance (from \\( P \\) to the circle), it means the chord is 2 units closer to the center than the point where the perpendicular from \\( P \\) intersects the circle. Therefore, the perpendicular from the center \\( O \\) to the chord \\( \\overline{AB} \\) divides \\( \\overline{AB} \\) into two equal parts and forms a right-angled triangle with half the chord as one side, the radius minus 2 (which is 4) as another side, and the hypotenuse being the radius (6).

      "To compute the remainder when the product of the remaining digits on the sheet of paper is divided by 1000, we will break down the problem into steps. First, determine the digits that are left after erasing 0 and 5. After erasing 0 and 5 from the numbers 1 to 2019, we are left with the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.",
      "Second, analyze the units digit of the product. Since we want the remainder when the product is divided by 1000, we can focus on the units digit of the product. The units digit will be determined by the product of the units digits of the individual numbers.",
      "Third, compute the product of the units digits. Let's consider the numbers from 1 to 2019. For every number that ends in 0 or 5, we erase those digits, so they don't contribute to the product of the units digits. We are left with numbers that end in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9. There are 200 numbers that end in 1 (1, 11, ..., 2001), 200 numbers that end in 2 (2, 12, ..., 2002), and so on. The product of the units digits will be: (1 × 1 × ... × 1) × (2 × 2 × ... × 2) × ... × (9 × 9 × ... × 9) where each factor appears 200 times. Using modular arithmetic, we can simplify this product: (1^200) × (2^200) × (3^200) × (4^200) × (6^200) × (7^200) × (8^200) × (9^200).",
      "Since we are interested in the remainder when divided by 1000, we can reduce each factor modulo 1000. Using Euler's totient theorem, we know that for any number a coprime to n, we have: a^(φ(n)) ≡ 1 (mod n) where φ(n) is Euler's totient function. For our case, n = 1000 = 2^3 × 5^3, and φ(1000) = 400. Since 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are all coprime to 1000, we can apply Euler's totient theorem: (1^200) × (2^200) × (3^200) × (4^200) × (6^200) × (7^200) × (8^200) × (9^200) ≡ (1^0) × (2^0) × (3^0) × (4^0) × (6^0) × (7^0) × (8^0) × (9^0) (mod 1000) ≡ 1 (mod 1000).",
      "However, we still need to consider the powers of 2 and 5. When we erased the digits 0 and 5, we removed some powers of 2 and 5 from the product. Let's analyze how many powers of 2 and 5 were removed. For every multiple of 10 (10, 20, ..., 2000), we removed one power of 2 and one power of 5. There are 200 such multiples, so we removed 200 powers of 2 and 200 powers of 5. For every multiple of 100 (100, 200, ..., 1900), we removed an additional power of 2 and an additional power of 5. There are 19 such multiples, so we removed an additional 19 powers of 2 and 19 powers of 5. In total, we removed 219 powers of 2 and 219 powers of 5 from the product.",
      "Finally, compute the final product. Since we removed 219 powers of 2 and 219 powers of 5, we need to multiply the result by 2^219 × 5^219 to compensate. However, since we are interested in the remainder when divided by 1000, we can reduce the exponents modulo 1000: 2^219 × 5^219 ≡ 2^19 × 5^19 (mod 1000). Using modular arithmetic, we can simplify this expression: 2^19 × 5^19 ≡ 524288 × 524288 (mod 1000) ≡ 688 (mod 1000). Therefore, the final product is: 1 × 688 (mod 1000) ≡ 688 (mod 1000).",

      "To ensure that the gardener can make as many trees as possible majestic, the gardener needs to consider the worst-case scenario, where the lumberjack chooses the four squares that will decrease the height of trees the most. Let's assume that the gardener has already increased the height of all trees on a certain square to make them majestic. In the next round, the lumberjack will choose four squares to decrease the height of trees by 1. This means that the lumberjack will decrease the height of at least 4 trees. To counter this, the gardener needs to increase the height of at least 5 trees to majestic height.

Bottle B: $y < 50$. Bottle C: $z < 50$. We also know that the total mass of the mixture taken is 60 grams, so: $x + y + z = 60$.

      "With these values of y and z, we can find the corresponding value of x: $x = 60 - y - z = 60 - 30 - 30 = 0$. This means that no mixture was taken from bottle A, which is plausible given the constraint x < 40.",

      "To find the percentage of acid in the new mixture, we need to divide the total acid content by the total mass of the new mixture and multiply by 100: $\\frac{14}{60} \\cdot 100 = \\boxed{23.33\\%}$."

Since both equations are equal to \\( y \\), we can set them equal to each other: \\( \\log_{10}(x-2) = 1 - \\log_{10}(x+1) \\).",
      "Now, let's use the properties of logarithms to simplify the equation.

      "This is a quadratic equation. We can factor it: \\( (x - 4)(x + 3) = 0 \\). This gives us two possible values for \\( x \\): \\( x - 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 4 \\) and \\( x + 3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -3 \\).",

The plane's speed is 1.5 miles per minute faster than what it would have been for the originally scheduled flight. Compute the distance (in miles) that the plane travels.",
    "steps": [
      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. First, we determine the flight duration in terms of \\(T\\). We're given that the scheduled flight duration is \\(T + 30\\) minutes, and the actual flight duration is \\(T\\) minutes.",
      "Next, we define the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's original speed as \\(v\\) miles per minute. With a tailwind, its speed increases to \\(v + 1.5\\) miles per minute.",
      "We then calculate the distance using the actual flight duration. The distance \\(D\\) traveled by the plane can be calculated using the formula: \\[D = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\\] Since the plane's actual flight time is \\(T\\) minutes, and we know its speed with the tailwind is \\(v + 1.5\\) miles per minute, the distance traveled is: \\[D = (v + 1.5) \\times T\\]",
      "To relate the scheduled flight duration to the plane's speed without considering the tailwind, we note that without any additional information about the plane's speed or the distance covered, we cannot directly solve for \\(v\\) from the information provided. However, we can express the relationship between the scheduled and actual flight durations through the plane's speed. Given that the scheduled flight was supposed to last \\(T + 30\\) minutes but ended up lasting \\(T\\) minutes with a higher speed due to a tailwind, the distance covered would remain the same under ideal conditions. This means the plane must have traveled the same distance in \\(T\\) minutes as it would have in \\(T + 30\\) minutes at its original speed \\(v\\).",
      "Using the relation between scheduled and actual flight times, if the plane's flight time decreased by 30 minutes but its speed increased by 1.5 miles per minute, the plane still covers the same distance. Thus, the original flight duration \\(T + 30\\) corresponds to a distance \\(D = v \\times (T + 30)\\).",
      "We combine the equations to solve for \\(D\\). We already have an expression for \\(D\\) in terms of \\(T\\) and \\(v + 1.5\\): \\[D = (v + 1.5) \\times T\\] And since both expressions represent the same distance \\(D\\), we equate them: \\[v \\times (T + 30) = (v + 1.5) \\times T\\] However, to find \\(D\\) directly without solving for \\(v\\), we notice that the question focuses on finding the distance covered, not the speed. Since we understand that the plane covers the same distance \\(D\\) under different conditions, we don't need to solve for \\(v\\) explicitly.",
      "Finally, we conclude with the answer. Given the setup, the key insight is that the distance \\(D\\) remains constant despite changes in speed and flight duration. Without loss of generality, knowing the relationship between scheduled and actual flight times implies that the distance covered is effectively calculated based on the actual flight conditions, which is: \\[D = (v + 1.5) \\times T\\] Given the problem's constraints, the direct calculation of \\(D\\) requires understanding that the scenario is designed to illustrate how adjustments in flight parameters affect travel distance under a fixed condition. Specifically, the distance \\(D\\) is dependent on the actual flight duration \\(T\\) and the adjusted speed \\(v + 1.5\\) miles per minute. To provide a concrete numerical answer, we'd typically need specific values for \\(T\\) and \\(v\\). However, based on the information provided and the approach taken, the distance covered by the plane can be represented symbolically as: \\[D = (v + 1.5) \\times T\\] This equation encapsulates the relationship between the plane's speed with the tailwind, its actual flight duration, and the distance traveled, leveraging the problem's unique conditions."

The mean is the average of all the numbers in the list. To minimize the sum, we want to minimize the mean, so we assume the list has the smallest possible number of elements, which is 3.

By the third minute, she would have flipped four switches (two in each of the first two minutes), leaving two switches unflipped. These could be Switches 1 and 2 or any other pair of unflipped switches.",
      "Final Minute: By the end of the third minute, Elizabeth will have flipped four switches, leaving her with the task of flipping the remaining switches (which includes either Switch 1 and/or Switch 2 and potentially others) in the last minute. Since she has been methodically flipping switches without concern for order, she should be able to flip the necessary switches to achieve all lights on within this last minute.",
      "Conclusion: Given the strategy outlined, the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, given \\( k = n - 2 \\), is **3** minutes. This is true for \\( n \\geq 5 \\), as it allows her to systematically manage the flipping of switches to ensure all are on by the end of the third minute, without needing to account for additional steps beyond this simplified analysis."

Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nCompute the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$.",
    "steps": [
      "To compute the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$, we first need to understand the properties of $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$. Since $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$ is a full town with 8 dishes, by definition, for every pair of dishes, there is exactly one resident who knows how to make them. Given that every resident knows how to make exactly 2 dishes and no two residents know how to make the same pair of dishes, the number of residents in $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$ can be determined by calculating the number of unique pairs that can be made from 8 dishes. This is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n=8$ (the total number of dishes) and $r=2$ (the number of dishes each resident knows). Therefore, the number of residents is $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8\\times7}{2\\times1} = 28$.",
      "Now, to find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6, we need to consider how these cycles form in $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$. In a cycle of length 6, each resident is connected to two others through their knowledge of dishes, forming a closed loop. Since each resident knows exactly two dishes and no two residents know the same pair of dishes, each pair of dishes can only appear once in a cycle.",
      "Let's analyze how many ways we can select 6 pairs out of 8 dishes to form a cycle. We start by selecting the first resident, which can be done in 28 ways. Then, we need to choose 5 more residents to complete the cycle. However, since we're considering distinguishable cycles, the order in which we select residents matters, making this a permutation problem rather than a simple combination.",
      "Given that we're choosing 6 dishes out of 8 to form a cycle, we can calculate the number of ways to do this as follows:\n- First, we choose 6 dishes out of 8, which can be done in $\\binom{8}{6} = \\frac{8!}{6!(8-6)!} = \\frac{8\\times7}{2\\times1} = 28$ ways.\n- For each selection of 6 dishes, we need to arrange them in a cycle. Since cycles are indistinguishable under rotation and reflection, we divide by the number of ways to arrange $n$ items in a circle, which is $(n-1)!$. Therefore, the number of distinguishable arrangements for a cycle of 6 dishes is $\\binom{8}{6} / 5! = 28 / 120 = 7/30$.",
      "However, this calculation does not directly provide the correct count of cycles because it includes the division by $5!$ which accounts for indistinguishable rotations and reflections. Instead, we should calculate the number of ways to arrange 6 dishes in a cycle without dividing by the circular permutations, which would give us $6!$ ways to arrange the dishes in a line, but since we are interested in cycles, we divide by $6$ for rotational symmetry and by $2$ for reflectional symmetry, leading to $6!/12$.",
      "Thus, for each selection of 6 dishes out of 8, we have $6!/12$ ways to arrange them in a cycle. Multiplying the number of ways to select 6 dishes by the number of ways to arrange them in a cycle, we get:\n\\[ \\binom{8}{6} \\times \\frac{6!}{12} = 28 \\times \\frac{720}{12} = 28 \\times 60 = 1680 \\]",
      "Therefore, the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$ is \\boxed{1680}."

      "To find the largest possible sum of the 15 answers, we first need to understand what an arithmetic progression is and how it works. An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is obtained by adding a fixed constant to the previous term. Let's denote the first term as 'a' and the common difference as 'd'. Since there are 15 terms in total, the last term can be represented as: a + (n - 1) * d = 999, where n is the number of terms (15 in this case).",

The smallest possible value for 'a' is 0 (000), since the answers are integers ranging from 000 to 999. So, we have: 0 + (15 - 1) * d = 999. This simplifies to 14 * d = 999, and solving for 'd' gives us d = 999 / 14, which is approximately 71.357. However, 'd' must be an integer, and we can't have a fraction of a digit in the answers. But since we're looking for the largest possible difference, we'll round down 'd' to the nearest integer, which is 71.",
      "Now, we need to verify if the sequence will exceed 999 when using 'd' = 71. We can plug in the value of 'd' into the equation for the last term: a + (n - 1) * d = 999. Substituting the values, we get 0 + (15 - 1) * 71 = 999, which simplifies to 14 * 71 = 994. Since 994 is less than 999, our first term 'a' should be 5, not 0, so that the last term will be 999. Therefore, the correct value of 'a' is 5.",

We already know that the last term 'l' is 999, and 'a' is 5. Substituting these values, we get Sum = 15/2 * (5 + 999), which simplifies to Sum = 7.5 * 1004, and finally, Sum = 7530.

A diagonal is called odd if its endpoints divide the boundary into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides. Since the total number of sides is 2006, which is even, each part must contain an odd number of sides.

This is because the sum of the lengths of the sides of a triangle must be even (since the perimeter of a polygon is even).",
      "Now, let's count the number of even and odd sides in the 2006-gon. Since the polygon has 2006 sides, half of them are even and half of them are odd. Therefore, there are 1003 even sides and 1003 odd sides. When we dissect the 2006-gon into triangles, each triangle will contribute exactly one even side (since the total number of sides is even and each triangle has exactly one even side). This means that the number of even sides used in the dissection is equal to the number of triangles, which is 2003.",
      "However, since there are only 1003 even sides in the polygon, it is impossible to use all 2003 even sides in the dissection. Therefore, the maximum number of even sides that can be used is 1003. Since each triangle with two odd sides uses exactly one even side, the maximum number of such triangles is 1003.

Since the area needed after \\( x = 4 \\) is less than the full area contributed by the interval, we know \\( w \\) is in the interval \\( [4, 5) \\).",

The ceiling function of any value in this range would be \\( 10 \\) at its highest, but since we are considering values strictly less than \\( 5 \\) for \\( w \\), and acknowledging the step nature of our area calculation, we aim to see if the doubling brings us directly to or just over \\( 9 \\), necessitating a ceiling of \\( 10 \\).",
      "## Step 9: Finalize computation based on approximation and step function nature\nRecognizing the approximation made and the step-wise increase in area, it's clear that without the precise area calculation for the fractional part of the interval, we lean on the understanding that \\( w \\)'s value necessitates \\( \\lceil 2w \\rceil \\) to be \\( 10 \\), given the constraints and the nature of the step function.

In this case, a matching represents a selfie with two or three students. However, since we're looking for pairs, we'll focus on matchings with two vertices per edge.",

For K8, |V| = 8 and |E| = 28 (since there are 8 choose 2 = 28 pairs). Thus, 28 / 2 ≤ m ≤ 7, which simplifies to m ≥ 14. Since we need to find the minimum number of selfies (which corresponds to the minimum number of matchings), and each matching represents at least 2 students, we can divide the minimum number of matchings by 2.

    "problem": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nFind the following in terms of $n$. $E(n, 2)$ for positive even integers $n$",
    "steps": [
      "To solve for \\( E(n, 2) \\) where \\( n \\) is a positive even integer, we need to consider how flipping two switches at a time affects our ability to get all \\( n \\) switches into the on position. Firstly, note that when \\( k=2 \\), flipping any two switches does not change the parity of the number of switches that are on. This means that if the number of switches that are on is odd, flipping two switches will result in either an odd or even number of switches being on, depending on whether both were previously off or one was on and the other was off, but the parity will change. If the number of switches that are on is even, flipping two switches will keep the number of switches that are on even. Initially, no switches are on, so there's an even number of switches that are on. Our goal is to reach an even number of switches that are on (specifically, all \\( n \\) switches, which is also an even number). This means we can only move from an even state to another even state, which is good since that's what we want.",
      "Now, let's consider how many flips we need to perform to ensure all switches are on. Since \\( n \\) is even, let \\( n = 2m \\) for some positive integer \\( m \\). To turn on all switches, we need to ensure each switch is flipped an odd number of times (since they all start off). When \\( k=2 \\), flipping any pair of switches doesn't guarantee that we cover every switch equally over time. However, we can approach this systematically. Let's say we have \\( n=4 \\) switches. We can turn them all on by flipping switches (1, 2), (3, 4), (1, 3), and (2, 4) in four moves, achieving the goal. For any even \\( n \\), we can divide the switches into \\( m = \\frac{n}{2} \\) pairs and flip each pair once. After \\( m \\) minutes, we will have flipped each switch exactly once, meaning half the switches are now on.",
      "To get all switches on, we need to repeat this process \\( m-1 \\) more times, alternating between pairs to ensure each switch is flipped an odd number of times. So, after \\( m + (m-1) = 2m - 1 = n - 1 \\) minutes, all switches should be on. However, this is not the most efficient strategy. A better strategy would be to flip every pair once, then re-flip every pair except one, ensuring that all but one switch is flipped twice and the last switch is flipped once, for a total of \\( 2(m-1) + 1 = 2m - 1 = n - 1 \\) flips, plus the initial \\( m \\) flips, giving us \\( n - 1 + m = 2m - 1 + m = 3m - 1 \\) flips. But since we aim to minimize the number of minutes and we've established that \\( m \\) flips are enough to ensure each switch is flipped at least once, the best strategy is just to ensure each switch is flipped an odd number of times, which can be done in \\( m \\) flips, as initially stated.",
      "Therefore, the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive even integers \\( n \\), when flipping two switches per minute is:\n\\[ E(n, 2) = m = \\frac{n}{2} \\]\nThis is assuming an optimal strategy where every switch is flipped exactly once before repeating, ensuring that after \\( m \\) flips, each switch has been flipped an odd number of times, thus turning all \\( n \\) switches on. The boxed answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{n}{2}}\\).",
      "Note: This solution assumes that the task of turning all switches on is possible given the constraints of flipping \\( k=2 \\) switches per minute. The scenario described does not require us to prove the feasibility of the task but rather calculates the minimum number of steps required under the assumption that the task is possible. In the context of the problem statement, since \\( k \\leq n \\), and \\( k=2 \\) for this case, turning all switches on is always feasible for even \\( n \\)."

      "Now, we can express y in terms of x from equation (1): y = x - 34",
      "Substituting this into equation (2), we get: x^2 + (x - 34)^2 = 1600 x^2 + x^2 - 68x + 1156 = 1600 2x^2 - 68x - 444 = 0 x^2 - 34x - 222 = 0",

      "We take the positive root since x represents a length: x = (34 + 45.24) / 2 ≈ 39.62",
      "Now, we can find y: y = x - 34 ≈ 39.62 - 34 ≈ 5.62",
      "The area of triangle ABC is given by: [A B C] = (1/2) * BC * AC ≈ (1/2) * 5.62 * 39.62 ≈ 111.62",
      "However, we need to check if there is an easier way to calculate the area without using the quadratic formula. Notice that (AC - BC)^2 = (T - 1)^2 = 34^2 = 1156. Also, (AC + BC)^2 = 2(AC^2 + BC^2) - (AC - BC)^2 = 2(AB^2) - (AC - BC)^2 = 2(40^2) - 1156 = 3200 - 1156 = 2044",
      "Now, we can use the fact that (AC + BC)^2 = 2044 and (AC - BC)^2 = 1156 to find the product AC * BC: (AC + BC)^2 - (AC - BC)^2 = 4 * AC * BC 2044 - 1156 = 4 * AC * BC 888 = 4 * AC * BC AC * BC = 888 / 4 AC * BC = 222",
      "Finally, the area of triangle ABC is: [A B C] = (1/2) * BC * AC = (1/2) * 222 = 111",

This means that the first person's birthday must be before the 14th of July, and the second person's birthday must be after the 14th of July. July has 31 days.

Since the first person's birthday must be before the 14th of July, and there are no Leo days before the 14th of July, the probability that the first person is a Leo is 0.

Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.",

      "### Step 2: Definition of a Resident Cycle\nA resident cycle of length \\( k \\) is a sequence of distinct residents \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_k \\) such that:\n- \\( r_i \\) and \\( r_{i+1} \\) know a common dish for \\( 1 \\leq i \\leq k-1 \\),\n- \\( r_k \\) and \\( r_1 \\) know a common dish,\n- No other pair \\( r_i \\) and \\( r_j \\) with \\( 1 \\leq i < j \\leq k \\) know a common dish.",
      "### Step 3: Counting Distinguishable Resident Cycles\nTo count the number of distinguishable resident cycles, we need to consider the following:\nFirst, we need to choose \\( k \\) dishes from the \\( d \\) available dishes. The order in which the dishes are chosen matters because it determines the order of the residents in the cycle. However, since the cycle can be rotated and reversed, we need to account for these symmetries.\nOnce we have chosen \\( k \\) dishes, we need to form a cycle of residents such that each pair of consecutive residents in the cycle knows a common dish. This is equivalent to forming a cycle of \\( k \\) vertices in a complete graph \\( K_d \\) (where each vertex represents a dish and each edge represents a resident).",
      "The number of ways to choose \\( k \\) dishes from \\( d \\) dishes is \\( \\binom{d}{k} \\). For each set of \\( k \\) dishes, the number of ways to form a cycle of \\( k \\) vertices in a complete graph is \\((k-1)!\\). However, since the cycle can be reversed, we divide by 2.",
      "Therefore, the total number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\) is:\n\\[ \\frac{\\binom{d}{k} (k-1)!}{2} \\]",
      "### Step 4: Simplifying the Expression\nWe can simplify the expression as follows:\n\\[ \\frac{\\binom{d}{k} (k-1)!}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{d!}{(d-k)! k!} (k-1)!}{2} = \\frac{d! (k-1)!}{2 (d-k)! k!} = \\frac{d!}{2 (d-k)! k} \\]",
      "Thus, the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\) in \\(\\mathcal{F}_d\\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{\\binom{d}{k} (k-1)!}{2}} \\]\nor equivalently,\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{d!}{2 (d-k)! k}} \\]"

Here's a strategy to achieve this: First, label the fields from 1 to \\( n^{2} \\) in a zigzag pattern, starting from the top-left corner and moving right, then down, then left, and so on. Second, for each square, place the largest number in the upper-left corner, the second-largest number in the upper-right corner, the third-largest number in the lower-left corner, and the fourth-largest number in the lower-right corner. Third, connect the fields within each square in increasing order, forming a \"snake-like\" path. This configuration ensures that each square has at most one good path starting from it.",
      "When Alice counts the good paths, she will count one path for each square, plus any additional paths that start from the edges or corners of the board. Now, let's count the number of good paths for this configuration: There are \\((n-1)^{2}\\) squares in the interior of the board, each contributing one good path. There are \\(n\\) squares along the top edge of the board, each contributing one good path. There are \\(n\\) squares along the left edge of the board, each contributing one good path. There are two squares at the top-left and bottom-right corners of the board, each contributing one good path. However, we have overcounted some paths. The paths that start from the top-left and bottom-right corners of the board are also counted among the paths that start from the interior squares. To correct for this, we need to subtract the number of paths that start from the interior squares and end at the top-left or bottom-right corners. Each of these paths corresponds to a diagonal path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. There are \\(n-1\\) such paths, since each diagonal path passes through \\(n-1\\) interior squares.",
      "Therefore, the total number of good paths is: \\(\\underbrace{(n-1)^{2}}_{\\text{squares in interior}} + \\underbrace{n}_{\\text{squares on top edge}} + \\underbrace{n}_{\\text{squares on left edge}} - \\underbrace{2}_{\\text{overcounted paths}} + \\underbrace{1}_{\\text{path from top-left to bottom-right}} = n^2 - 2n + 2.\\) However, this is not the smallest possible number of good paths. We can further reduce the number of good paths by placing the largest number in the center of the board, rather than the top-left corner. This creates a \"star-like\" configuration, where the largest number is surrounded by a ring of smaller numbers. The good paths in this configuration are the same as before, but with one fewer path starting from the center square. Therefore, the smallest possible number of good paths is: \\(n^2 - 2n + 2 - 1 = \\boxed{n^2 - 2n + 1}.\\)"

      "To find the area of $\\triangle ABC$, we need to know at least two sides and the included angle or all three sides. We're given two sides ($AB = 5$ and $AC = 6$) and an expression for $\\tan{\\angle BAC}$, which is negative. However, since angles in a triangle are positive, we'll interpret this as the tangent of the angle's measure when considering its standard position in the coordinate plane. The negative value suggests that we're looking at the direction or orientation of the angle rather than its size; the magnitude of the angle itself must be positive. Given that $\\tan{\\angle BAC} = -\\frac{4}{3}$, we can understand this as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side of a right-angled triangle formed with one of the sides of $\\triangle ABC$ (let's consider the triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from $C$ to line $AB$, forming right $\\triangle ADC$).",
      "This means if we let $AD$ be the adjacent side, and $DC$ be the opposite side, then: \\[ \\frac{DC}{AD} = \\frac{4}{3}. \\] Since $\\tan{\\angle BAC}$ gives us a ratio of sides in a right-angled triangle, we can create a right-angled triangle where the sides are in the ratio of $3:4:5$ (a Pythagorean triple), but our hypotenuse is $AC = 6$. We scale the basic $3:4:5$ triangle so that the hypotenuse becomes $6$. To do this, we divide each side by $5$ and multiply by $6$ to maintain the ratio: \\[ AD = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 6 = \\frac{18}{5}, \\] \\[ DC = \\frac{4}{5} \\times 6 = \\frac{24}{5}. \\]",

Thus, to ensure a switch stays on permanently, it should not be flipped after being turned on.\n- Since she leaves 27 switches untouched each round, the goal is to ensure these are the ones that stay on permanently.",

Let's consider these 27 as our target switches that will remain on.\n2. **Subsequent Rounds**: For each subsequent round, her strategy should aim to avoid flipping the 27 switches that were left untouched in the previous round while ensuring she flips exactly 1993 switches.\n3. **Dynamic Set of Untouched Switches**: With each round, she updates the set of 27 switches to avoid flipping, ensuring they remain on.",

      "Continuing this process, after $m$ rounds, she has left $27m$ switches on without flipping them since they were last turned on. To cover all 2020 switches, we need to solve for $m$ in the equation $27m \\geq 2020$.",

Given a set of reals $\\mathcal{F}$, and an element $x \\in \\mathcal{F}$, we say that the scales of $x$ in $\\mathcal{F}$ are the values of $D(x, y)$ for $y \\in \\mathcal{F}$ with $x \\neq y$.\n\nLet $k$ be a given positive integer. Suppose that each member $x$ of $\\mathcal{F}$ has at most $k$ different scales in $\\mathcal{F}$ (note that these scales may depend on $x$ ). What is the maximum possible size of $\\mathcal{F}$ ?",
    "steps": [
      "To find the maximum possible size of $\\mathcal{F}$, let's consider the following steps: First, understand the definition of $D(x, y)$. This function measures the distance between two real numbers $x$ and $y$ using powers of 2. It returns the unique integer $d$ such that $2^d \\leq |x-y| < 2^{d+1}$.",
      "Second, recognize that for any two different real numbers $x$ and $y$, the value of $D(x, y)$ depends only on the difference $|x-y|$, not on their actual values. This means that if $|x-y| = |z-w|$ for some other pair of numbers $(x, y)$ and $(z, w)$, then $D(x, y) = D(z, w)$.",
      "Third, note that since each member $x$ of $\\mathcal{F}$ has at most $k$ different scales in $\\mathcal{F}$, there can be at most $k$ distinct values of $D(x, y)$ for each $x$. Let's denote these values as $d_1, d_2, ..., d_k$, where $d_i$ corresponds to the $i$-th scale of $x$.",
      "Fourth, for each scale $d_i$ of $x$, consider all pairs of elements $(x, y)$ in $\\mathcal{F}$ such that $D(x, y) = d_i$. Since $2^{d_i} \\leq |x-y| < 2^{d_i + 1}$, there are at least $2^{d_i}$ and at most $2^{d_i + 1} - 1$ possible values of $y$ that satisfy this condition. This is because there are $2^{d_i}$ intervals of length $2^{d_i}$ between $x$ and $2^{d_i + 1}$, and each interval can contain at most one value of $y$.",
      "Fifth, since there are at most $k$ distinct scales for each $x$, the total number of pairs of elements $(x, y)$ in $\\mathcal{F}$ can be bounded by the sum of the number of possible values of $y$ for each scale. This gives us: $\\sum_{i=1}^k (2^{d_i} + 2^{d_i + 1} - 1)$.",
      "Sixth, to simplify the expression, note that the sum of the geometric series $2^{d_i} + 2^{d_i + 1} - 1$ can be written as $2^{d_i} \\cdot (1 + 2 - 1) = 2^{d_i} \\cdot 2 = 2^{d_i + 1}$.",
      "Seventh, therefore, the total number of pairs of elements $(x, y)$ in $\\mathcal{F}$ can be bounded by: $k \\cdot 2^{d_{max} + 1}$ where $d_{max}$ is the largest scale of any element in $\\mathcal{F}$.",
      "Eighth, however, we want to count the total number of elements in $\\mathcal{F}$, not pairs. Since each element $x$ in $\\mathcal{F}$ contributes to at most $k$ pairs (one for each scale), we need to divide the previous bound by $k$.",
      "Ninth, this gives us: $2^{d_{max} + 1}$.",
      "Tenth, recall that $d_{max}$ is the largest scale of any element in $\\mathcal{F}$. The largest possible value of $d_{max}$ is achieved when all elements in $\\mathcal{F}$ have the same scale. In this case, the largest possible value of $d_{max}$ is $k-1$, since each element has at most $k$ scales.",
      "Eleventh, therefore, the maximum possible size of $\\mathcal{F}$ is: $2^{(k-1) + 1} = 2^k$.",

It suggests that for any \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), there must exist a value of \\(f(y + f(x) - 1)\\) that allows for the formation of a triangle with sides \\(x\\), \\(f(y)\\), and \\(f(y + f(x) - 1)\\).",

      "Considering the implications of these inequalities, we realize that for a function \\(f\\) satisfying the given condition, it must grow at least linearly with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). A more direct approach to ensure the formation of triangles for all \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is to consider the simplest form that satisfies the conditions. The most straightforward function that meets these criteria is one where \\(f\\) grows linearly or faster with its argument. A simple candidate to test is \\(f(n) = n\\).",

Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nCompute the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$.",

The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nOne might guess that in most cases, $E(n, k) \\approx \\frac{n}{k}$. In light of this guess, define the inefficiency of the ordered pair $(n, k)$, denoted $I(n, k)$, as\n\n$$\nI(n, k)=E(n, k)-\\frac{n}{k}\n$$\n\nif $E(n, k) \\neq \\infty$.

However, the trick is that she may inadvertently turn off previously turned-on switches while trying to turn all of them on. This adds complexity to the problem, particularly when determining the minimum number of steps needed to ensure all switches are on simultaneously.",
      "Initial Approach: We need to devise a strategy where Elizabeth can flip 3 switches per minute in such a way that she can eventually have all 6 switches turned on without having to wait too many rounds due to turning off already-on switches. One naive approach could be to just randomly flip switches every round and hope for the best, but this won't necessarily minimize the number of rounds.",
      "Analyzing Possible Strategies: Let's consider strategies that Elizabeth could use:\nFirst, Strategy A: Flip three new switches each minute until all have been flipped at least once. Then, keep flipping three switches per minute to maintain all on. However, this strategy doesn't account for turning off already-on switches.\nSecond, Strategy B: Carefully choose which switches to flip based on their current state (on/off) to avoid turning off already-on switches unnecessarily.",
      "Evaluating Strategy B for Specific Cases: Given we have 6 switches and flip 3 each time:\n- In the first round, Elizabeth can flip any 3 switches.\n- In the second round, she can flip the remaining 3 switches to ensure that all have been turned on at least once.\n- From the third round onwards, she must carefully select which 3 switches to flip. Ideally, she wants to avoid flipping any switch that's already on unless necessary to flip another switch that's still off.",
      "Determining Minimum Rounds: Let's see how many rounds Strategy B takes:\n- Round 1: Turn on 3 switches.\n- Round 2: Turn on the remaining 3 switches. Now all 6 switches are on.\n- However, from the third round onwards, she has to flip 3 switches again, potentially turning off some of those that were already on. But since our aim is to get all on and they are all on after round 2, no further flips are necessary. Therefore, \\( E(6,3) = 2 \\).",

      "Vector addition \\(\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}\\) is straightforward; it simply adds corresponding elements of two vectors. Element-wise maximum \\(\\mathbf{v} \\vee \\mathbf{w}\\) takes the maximum value for each corresponding position from the two vectors.",
      "Since we're dealing with integer-valued tuples, we should consider how these operations work with integers. The key insight here is that using both operations allows us to manipulate the values in a tuple independently, which is crucial for being able to generate any possible tuple.",
      "To be able to generate any integer-valued 2022-tuple, we need at least one starting tuple where each component can be manipulated independently. This means we need at least one tuple per coordinate to manipulate that specific coordinate's value without affecting others.

      "Consider the role of a zero tuple \\((0, 0, ..., 0)\\). This tuple, when used in vector addition, will not change any tuple it's added to.

A tuple of all ones \\((1, 1, ..., 1)\\) would be interesting for element-wise maximum operation because it could potentially \"turn on\" any zero or negative values in other tuples to positive.",
      "To ensure we can manipulate each coordinate independently, we need tuples that can specifically target each coordinate. The idea is to have tuples that contain a single 1 at each coordinate and zeros elsewhere. This set would allow us to increment any desired coordinate while keeping others fixed. We need 2022 such tuples, one for each coordinate, to directly control every coordinate. However, considering our operations, we can reduce this number by noticing that we can generate any tuple containing exactly one non-zero value (which we can assume is 1) by using the maximum operation on a tuple containing all zeros and a tuple containing all ones.",

However, since we can generate any tuple with a single 1 using just the first two, we don't need this third tuple in its most general form. Instead, any tuple that allows us to manipulate one coordinate differently from the others suffices. For example, \\((1, 0, 0, ..., 0)\\).",

      "To find the largest possible $k$ such that the numbers $y_1, \\ldots, y_k$ are all prime, we'll follow these steps: First, understand the sequence $x_n$. We're given the sequence $x_n$ defined as: $x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1$ for $n \\geq 1$, with $x_1 = a$. Let's start by computing the first few terms of this sequence: $x_1 = a$, $x_2 = 2x_1 + 1 = 2a + 1$, $x_3 = 2x_2 + 1 = 2(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 3$, $x_4 = 2x_3 + 1 = 2(4a + 3) + 1 = 8a + 7$.",

Notice that each $y_n$ is one less than a power of two. This means that $y_n$ is an odd number, which makes it a candidate for being prime (except for $1$).",
      "Now, analyze the primality of $y_n$. We claim that for $n > 2$, the numbers $y_n$ are not prime.

Notice that $2^{x_n + 1} - 1$ is a multiple of $2^{x_n} - 1$, hence a multiple of $y_n$.
